> [!TIP]
> Looking for a friend to go with Chicken? Check out the [Godot Plush][godot-plush] 3D character.

Chicken has no pronouns. Chicken is just Chicken, referred to only by name ‚Äî Chicken.

## üé¨ Credits

Chicken was created by [Tibo], a talented technical artist who is a pleasure to work with. You can find [Tibo] on [BlueSky][TiboBsky]!

## üì∫ Demo

A variant of the Godot Plush project was created to demonstrate some of Chicken's animations in a real game setting. You can use this to test Chicken in your own projects or as a reference for how to use the animations.

## üßä Blender File

The original source blender file is included. I'm not a professional 3D artist, so I probably won't be touching this much. It relies on the [Game Rig Tools][game-rig-tools] add-on for rigging and animation best practices.

If you want to contribute more animations, please open a PR with the animations added to the Blender file and re-export to `components/chickensoft_skin/chickensoft_mascot.glb`. Please note that any animation contributions would be licensed under the [CC0 1.0][CC0] license.
